# Welcome to the wiki!

This is the website version of the following repositories from @[[ajhalili2006]] himself:

* [Kooky Insane Stuff](https://github.com/ajhalili2006-experiments/kooky-insane-stuff)
* [The old Digital Garden repo](https://mau.dev/andreijiroh.dev/digital-garden)

The former two will be merged here and their former homes be converted into
redirect pointers (to not break backlinks in Agora), alongside some cleanups.
If you are looking for his Autistic Life Notebook, it is on [Traumatized Autists Department][ttad].
