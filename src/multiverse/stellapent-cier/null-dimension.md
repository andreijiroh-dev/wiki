* The `/dev/null` in this entry on digital garden is a technical choice due to @ajhalili2006's Linux usage.
* Alternative names: Shadow Realm[^1], Binary Dimension[^2]
* Possibly a [[Yupia]]/[[Erase Humanity]] reference in Gildedguy Stories, especially Story 7 and Story 8.
    * In the Murder Drones universe, it is an artifically-made black holes that can be made by drones that possess the [[AbsoluteSolver]].
