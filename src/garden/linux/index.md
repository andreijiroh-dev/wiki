# All things Linux!

!!! warning "Work in progress"
    Still ironing out the documentation right now, apologies for missing info and links.

This wiki section contains documentation about how I use Linux in daily
life, from the distributions I use to workarounds I did for apps that don't
work natively (yet)

## Quick Links

* [dotfiles](./dotfiles.md)
* [Nix flakes-based configs for NixOS + home-manager](./nixops-config.md)

## Related
