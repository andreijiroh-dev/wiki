# Foam

* golink pointer for [`go/foam`](https://go.andreijiroh.xyz/foam): <https://foambubble.github.io/foam/>
* In the Agora of Flanica: <https://anagora.org/foam>
* Roam-like project, built on VS Code + Git, also a [[agora client]]
    * It is currently my Agora client as of [[2024-06-12]] alongside building the site with Mkdocs using the Material theme, since I switched my Obsidian usage for private notes.

## Getting Started

1. [Use this repo template][use-template] or [fork it][fork] from upstream in GitHub.
Alternatively, you can import it as fresh repo if you like.
2. Install [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/install) or use its web version (hint: press `.` or replace `github.com` with `github.dev` in address bar).
3. Once the repo is cloned into your machined or the VS Code for Web is loaded,
allow to install recommended extensions.
4. You're ready to use Foam.
