# Personal Garden

!!! warning "Currently migrating content from the old repo"
    During the school break, I'll be working on importing and updating
    content from the old repo into here, including old daily note entries.
    You can track its progress [here](../migration-progress.md) for more details.

This is where I cultivate my thoughts, take down notes on things, and more.
Generally speaking a wiki of sorts, powered by [[Foam]] and [[Material for Mkdocs]].
