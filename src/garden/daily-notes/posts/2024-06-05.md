# Daily Note 2024-06-05

Here's a quick summary of what's cooking behind the scenes today, June 5, 2024:

* Nothing particular happened lately for now, just regular household chores and chilling out during the break
* What I have been listening to ([check today scrobbles](https://www.last.fm/user/ajhalili2006/library?from=2024-06-05&to=2024-06-05)):
    * Tuned in a bit of BCC Radio 1's morning show (stream archive [in BCC Sounds player](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/m001zkc6) or via [my own archives](https://cdn.api.andreijiroh.xyz/storj/getStaticLink?bucket=vod-archives&station=bbcr1&archive_pid=m001zkc6))
    * [[The Spawn Chunks]] EP300 ([youtube](https://youtu.be/fBe7E-FKJqU), [pod.link](https://pod.link/1433556215/episode/cd991c6ac37535b4822c191eff42976f)) - mainly to catch up with Minecraft news and Q&A section with the hosts

    </div>

* Maybe seen about the Minecraft 15-Year Anniversary docuseries from their official channel then?

That's all for now, see you again soon for another daily note. If I miss something today, I may edit this page or just add it for next daily note instead. Take care.
