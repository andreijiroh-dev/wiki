# Daily Note 2024-06-04

Here's a quick summary of what's cooking behind the scenes today, June 04, 2024:

* The holy grails: Fanfictions, neck kisses (goddamnit [[Smallishbeans]])
    * Will link them later, it's just past midnight Wednesday now.
* What I have been listening to ([check today scrobbles](https://www.last.fm/user/ajhalili2006/library?from=2024-06-04&to=2024-06-04)):
    * [[BOSSFIGHT]]'s [Vermin](https://open.spotify.com/track/4sSDPuQLBSowFuPtXBzUI5?si=bb180277fdce4aab)
