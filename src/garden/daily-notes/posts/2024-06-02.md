It's been [more than 7 months] since the last one and it's nice I could do it all again here in the new wiki, and it's good to be back again with the daily journaling hellscapes.

By the way, here's a quick summary of what's cooking behind the scenes today, June 2, 2024:

* Chilling like madlad, currently recovering after a almost all-nighter clothes folding before 3AM local time
    * Also earlier (and since yesterday): I am casually rewatched One vs Skid/Skid vs One for a refresher after watching the [[Gildedguy Story 8]] premiere VOD on Twitch
    * I am such a madlad to download it twice and store it in Storj DCS. That should cost me 15-20 PHP more on storage (long-term) and egress (for the month of May 2024).
* Expect the [[May 2024 Status Update]] to published on or before June 12 ([[Philippine Independence Day]])
* What I have been listening to ([check today scrobbles](https://www.last.fm/user/ajhalili2006/library?from=2024-06-02&to=2024-06-02)):
    * [[BOSSFIGHT]]'s [Ballistic](https://youtu.be/_aLxnMuwFxA) right off [[Release Radar]] Spotify playlist
    * [[Starcadian]][^1]'s [He^rt](https://open.spotify.com/track/0wKO2qrYbK7EXhceYyGhjw?si=bc0c5b03dc154688) and [Entoptica](https://open.spotify.com/track/5SYYfoHNkDBgBWawXbYc4H?si=0706fd3e8e7a43c3)
    * Punch Deck[^2]'s [Dominant](<https://youtu.be/AEmUhumZVX0>)
    * Duolingo's [YouTube short] sent me to [Jaxomy & Agatino Romero Remix][remix-hell] version of Raffaella Carr√†'s [Pedro](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCqvSSfsP6w)[^3]
    * Ending off with [The Verge's interview with Google CEO](https://youtu.be/lqikP9X9-ws), currently at `32m33s` as of time of writing.

That's all for now, see you again soon for another daily note. If I miss something today, I may edit this page or just add it for next daily note instead. Take care.

[^1]: You may not realize this, but Starcadian's music has lore in it, its storyline is similar Alan Walker's and PYLOT's, although this may hit hard for Lord Hurdon listeners. Also got hooked into [Alien Victory](https://open.spotify.com/track/1567PJ30QKSrgF95xP8lbh?si=603b3a3d73c04a4b) first after [[Gildedguy Story 6]]
[^2]: Listened first with [MORE MORE MORE](https://open.spotify.com/track/0ijpBAIGFiMyzgMUCQuKCs?si=126e777a28b04e02) from one of the previews on X (Twitter) for [Gildedguy: Automatica fan animation](https://wiki.andreijiroh.xyz/multifandom/stellapent-cier/automatica-fananimation)
[remix-hell]: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKL20WFmVrw>
[YouTube short]: https://www.youtube.com/shorts/_NzpNsuVn8Y
[^3]: Gonne too deep and [the wiki page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedro_(song)#Jaxomy_and_Agatino_Romero_version) made me say "oh my god" in Scar's voice
