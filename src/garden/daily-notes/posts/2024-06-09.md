# Daily Note 2024-06-09 and Weekly Wrap Issue No. 1

Here's a quick summary of what's cooking behind the scenes today alongside anything else you missed this week, June 9, 2024:

* For this week's edition of the Weekly Wrap (stats galore)
    * What did you missed this week
        * The week starts with [**The Return of Daily Notes**](https://wiki.andreijiroh.xyz/garden/daily-notes/2024-06-02) and ends with [**Friday Mixtape Hellscape**](https://wiki.andreijiroh.xyz/garden/daily-notes/2024-06-07), featuring Taylor Swift's Tortured Poets Department and support for comments on these via giscus and GitHub Discussions APIs.
        * [See all posts here in one place](https://wiki.andreijiroh.xyz/tags/#weekly-wrap-s2024-01)
    * From my Wakatime stats this week[^1]: I am literally on VS Code for more than half a day (12h+) this week, mostly to edit Markdown files on my personal wiki locally, although I do use GitHub's web editor (VS Code for Web edition) and Codespaces for some.
    * For the recap yesterday, apologies if I didn;t write one: Nothing particular happened, just a day off updating my personal wiki in the machine to rest up and catch up with my Duolingo streak before clock strikes midnight.
    * For my listening activity at Last.fm for [the period of May 31 to June 6] ([archived link]):
        * Scrobbled 559 tracks (up 38% from last week), with 66 this week on 9:00 PM hour block.
        * Listened for almost 2 days (1 day 23 hours), averaging 80 scrobbles per day, with 126 as highest this week on June 3.
        * For the music ratio, I listened to 110 tracks (with ratio of 5.08 scrobbles/track compared to 87 with ratio of 6.43 last week) from 41 artists (ratio of 13.63 scrobbles/artist compared to 39 last week with ratio of 14.33) across 49 albums (ration of 11.41 scrobbles/album vs 36 last week with ratio of 15.53).
        * Top Album, Song and Track: [Starcadian] [^2] and his [Sunset Blood] album | [BOSSFIGHT]'s [Ballistic] (also top new track and album as single this week)
    * Perfect attendance this week on Duolingo's Spanish or Vanish sessions (7 out of 7 days this week, totaling 174 days streak, compared with 6 last week).[^3]
* What I have been listening to ([check today's scrobbles](https://www.last.fm/user/ajhalili2006/library?from=2024-06-08&to=2024-06-09)):
    * Next up from my podcast queue, featuring Anthony Padilla: [The Try Guys Tell All](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUoZRtzegkU)

That's all for now, see you again soon for another daily note. If I miss something today, I may edit this page or just add it for next daily note instead. Take care, and keep it decent in the comments.

[^1]: Downloading dashboard stats involves upgrading to premium, so apologies if I couldn't dump the screenshot of my dashboard for now here.
[^2]: For the uninitated (hello there if you have watched [[Gildedguy Story 6]] earlier), he makes "ear movies" or music with lore in a nutshell.
[^3]: Track my progress at <https://www.duolingo.com/profile/ajhalili2006> and follow me if you do.
