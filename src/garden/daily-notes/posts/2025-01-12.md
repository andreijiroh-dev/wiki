# Daily Note 2025-01-10 / Holidays + Weekly Dump from 2024-12-21 to 2025-01-12

!!! warning "Hack Club Slack links ahead"
    To access them, you must be [in the Slack](https://hackclub.com/slack) (high schoolers 18 and below if you are not yet there)

Here's what I been cooking behind the scenes for today, as well as
the holidays dump during the break (2024-12-21 to 2025-01-05) and this
school week (2025-01-06 to 2025-01-10), as well as the weekends
(2025-01-11 and 2025-01-12).

I know it's a long break from both doing the daily notes and the long-form
blog content, mainly because of school and being hit by the burnout bus.

## Holidays Dump 2024

Now let's talk about what in the living hellscape happened I did during the holidays
break, which involves [High Seas Sticky Holidays](https://hackclub.slack.com/archives/C07TNAZGMHS/p1734472089956779):

* literally shipped [RecapTime.dev Website](https://github.com/recaptime-dev/website/tree/labs/mkdocs-material) before the midnight of January 1, 2025
    * last project to ship before midnight (PH Standard Time): [SpinStack - Vinyl Record Manager](https://hackclub.slack.com/archives/C07UA18MXBJ/p1735660732744849) by [Oliver Potter](https://hackclub.slack.com/team/U078VEJRBR7) ([repo](https://github.com/opott/SpinStack), [demo](https://github.com/opott/SpinStack))
* cooking up between [HCB Explorer Discord bot](https://github.com/recaptime-dev/hcb-explorer-discord) and [Hack Club Leeksbot](https://github.com/recaptime-dev/hackclub-leeksbot) behind the scenes
* probably resting between dev work and chores
* switching to NixOS with flake-based setup, alongside using `home-manager`

## School Week 2025-01-06 to 2025-01-10

* preparing for upcoming Work Immersion schedule on February, among other things
* shipped Leeksbot and dotfiles + NixOS configurations, seperated by just a day
* done a lot of voting at the Wonderdome to bring my projects for other to vote, got the sea's blessings for a extra 20% doubloons

## The Weekends 2025-01-11 and 2025-01-12

TODO to self: go write this after [[High Seas]]
