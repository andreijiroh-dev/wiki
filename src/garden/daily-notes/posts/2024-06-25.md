# Daily Note 2024-06-25

Here's a quick summary of what's cooking behind the scenes today, June 25, 2024:

* [Created a new repo](https://github.com/recaptime-dev/transparency-log-threads) in @recaptime-dev for transparency log/communication threads, similar to [delegate communication threads] in Arbitrum governance forum
    * Here's mine if you want a preview: <https://github.com/recaptime-dev/transparency-log-threads/issues/1>
* What I have been listening to ([check today scrobbles](https://www.last.fm/user/ajhalili2006/library?from=2024-06-24&to=2024-06-25)):
    * Nothing new for now.
* A bit of catching up on Jet Lag: The Game series while waiting for the Season 10 finale.

That's all for now, see you again soon for another daily note. If I miss something today, I may edit this page or just add it for next daily note instead. Take care.
