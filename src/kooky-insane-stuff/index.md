# Jiroh's Kooky Insane Stuff

!!! warning "Migration in progress"
    After some time, I'll be start to migrate wiki contents from [the former repo] into
    this section (and other places) in the wiki.

[![Nori's Kooky Insane Stuff in Murder Drones S01EP03](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/murder-drones/images/7/73/Screenshot_2023-02-20_NORIS_KOOKY_INSANE_STUFF.png)](https://murder-drones.fandom.com/wiki/The_Promening#Plot){loading=lazy}

This section contains unhinged-as-hell fanfiction ideas, drafts for my blog that you shouldn't go
other than the spoiler tag and cursed ship names, and even some politics and internet shitfuckery
in between (bet no one will dare to dig anyone's digital graves) like Uzi Doorman in Murder Drones.

Don't worry, he's probably fine other than the regular internalized ableism and too much on
"beating himself up harder every time he fucked up" as (actually) Autistic (currently [masking like hell IRL][masking-hell-tweet],
but working on it behind the scenes) person.
